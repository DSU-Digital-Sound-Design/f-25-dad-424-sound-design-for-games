# **Exercise 3: Game Music Analysis & Adaptive Design**

## **Project Overview**

Building on Level 6 – Compose Yourself!: The Art of Composing for Games, this project asks you to analyze how games use linear and non-linear music, identify adaptive techniques, and design a music interaction map for a hypothetical level. You will present your findings to the class in a timed presentation.

## **Learning Outcomes**

* Identify differences between linear and non-linear scoring in shipped games
* Examine and label real uses of loops, branching, and transitions with timestamps
* Recognize production and design factors that shape adaptive scoring choices
* Apply vertical (layering) and horizontal (re-sequencing) concepts by designing a cohesive music system for gameplay

## **Deliverables**

**Class Presentation (7–8 minutes + 2 minutes Q\&A)**
Your slides must include:

* **Part A – Scene Analysis (Linear vs Non-Linear)**

  * Game title, level/mission, platform, and source of gameplay capture (own play or approved stream/VOD link)
  * Function of the music: mood/tone, time/place, location identity, character, pace, immersion
  * Classification of linear vs non-linear passages, with at least 5 timestamped examples

* **Part B – Adaptive Techniques Table**

  * Examples from the same game (or a second game if needed)
  * Techniques from: vertical layering, crossfade, phrase branching, musical demarcation, bridge, stinger, horizontal re-sequencing
  * For each, show timestamp(s), describe what you hear, and explain why the technique fits

* **Part C – Music Interaction Map (Design)**
  * Diagram of a hypothetical level’s music system, showing:
    * States (e.g., Explore → Suspicion → Combat → Victory → Explore)
    * Vertical stems per state and when they enter/exit
    * Horizontal transitions and techniques used
    * Rules for timing, fade lengths, and triggers
    * Tools: 
        * [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings) — free, collaborative diagramming app within Google Workspace.
        * [diagrams.net (Draw.io)](https://www.drawio.com/) — robust, open-source diagram editor, works in-browser or offline.

## **Presentation Checklist**

* Introduce the game and why you chose it
* Show a short clip of the scene with music
* Pause to explain what technique is being used and what triggers the change
* Connect your example to concepts from Level 6 page
* Present your adaptive techniques table highlights (2–3 strongest examples)
* Show your music interaction map and explain how it works in gameplay
* Summarize your key takeaway about how music impacts the game
* Keep within 7–8 minutes for the main presentation, leaving 1–2 minutes for questions
