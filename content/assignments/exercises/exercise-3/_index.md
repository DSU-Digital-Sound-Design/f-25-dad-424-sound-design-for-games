# Exercise 3: Voice Over

## Assignment

You are tasked with recording voice over assets for an upcoming story based adventure game.

You are to record the voice over assets for two characters, **Medi** and **Samsel**. **Medi** is a young sidekick companion to the main character. **Samsel** is a mystical old sage whose advice is not always helpful. Both characters' avatars are gender non-specific.

You will record voice over assets and deliver them, along with an updated [`script-sheet.xlsx`](script-sheet.xlsx) file.

> Download the assets list here: [script-sheet.xlsx](script-sheet.xlsx)

You can read the lines yourself or recruit voice over talent, but **You are required to be the recording engineer.** I will be looking for well recorded/edited audio, not perfect performances.

### Audio asset requirements

- **Each file must be a 24bit, 44.1kHz .wav file.**
- Each sound should be in a directory called `vo_takes`
- Filenames should be short, and start with the character name:
  - For example:
    - `Medi_a.wav`
- Each file should only contain takes for one line
- Multiple takes for each line are encouraged
  - please keep to one file per line reading
  - please edit out any extraneous sounds
  - keep ~2 seconds of silence between each take
- Each file should be peak normalized to -5 dBFs
- Each take should have minimal background noise and room reflections
- Each take should be close mic'd
- Each file should have less than 0.25 seconds of silence at beginning
- Each file should have less than 0.25 seconds of silence at ending

### Communication

If needed, please leave any notes on the sounds provided in the `Voice Talent Notes` field.

An script sheet / asset list is provided with a list of requested lines. **Update `script-sheet.xlsx` with the filename, and any notes you have for the game designer.** Notes should be clear in meaning and directed toward the Game Designer in how to use the sound.

### Studio Usage

You must use the DSU recording studio for this project. Studio time is booked through the Charm Studios Website:
