# Exercise 2: Voice Over Production

## Objective

You will act as the recording engineer for an story-driven adventure game. Your task is to record and prepare high-quality voice-over files for two characters:

* **Medi** – youthful, energetic sidekick
* **Samsel** – calm, wise, mystical sage

The [script sheet](script-sheet.xlsx) lists all the lines, along with performance notes from the Game Designer.

## Requirements

### Recording Specifications

* **Format:** 24-bit, 44.1 kHz WAV
* **Directory:** Place all files in a folder called `vo_takes/`
* **Naming:**
  * Format: `Character_lineID.wav` (e.g., `Medi_a.wav`)
  * If multiple takes: `Character_lineID_var01.wav`, `Character_lineID_var02.wav`
* **One line per file** – no mixing characters or multiple script lines in the same file
* **Multiple takes** (optional): Keep them in the same file for that line, separated by **2 seconds of silence**
* **Editing:** Remove unwanted noises; apply short fades to avoid clicks; limit start/end silence to < 0.25 seconds
* **Normalization:** Peak normalize to **-5 dBFS**
* **Noise:** Use close miking to minimize background noise and reflections

## Studio Usage

All recording must be done in the **DSU recording studio**. Book your time early via:

## Spreadsheet Columns — Abbreviated Guide

* **Character** – Who is speaking (Medi or Samsel)
* **Lines** – Exact dialogue; do not change wording unless instructed
* **Game Designer Notes** – Tone/performance cues — follow closely when recording
* **Filename** – Enter your saved filename after recording
* **Voice Talent Notes** – Your observations for the designer (e.g., performance variations, take count, issues, mic technique)

## Communication & Notes

If you create multiple takes, explain in **Voice Talent Notes** why they differ. Example:

> “Take 3 is softer for emotional emphasis; take 4 is slightly slower for clarity.”

---

## Deliverables

1. `vo_takes/` folder with all files organized by character
2. Updated `script-sheet_cleaned.xlsx` with filenames and notes completed
3. Raw unedited recordings in `_src/` (optional but recommended)
