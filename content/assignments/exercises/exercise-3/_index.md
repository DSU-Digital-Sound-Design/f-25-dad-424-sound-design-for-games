# Exercise 3: Voice Over Production

In this exercise, you will engage in the production of voice-over assets for an immersive story-driven adventure game. The task involves recording dialogue for two distinct characters, Medi and Samsel, and meticulously preparing the audio files for integration into the game.

## Objective

Your primary role is to function as the recording engineer, ensuring the production of high-quality audio files for the characters Medi and Samsel. Medi is envisioned as a youthful sidekick, while Samsel embodies a mystical sage with enigmatic advice.

## Requirements and Guidelines

### Recording Specifications

- **Format and Quality**: Each voice-over file must be a 24-bit, 44.1kHz WAV file.
- **Storage**: Organize all voice-over files within a directory named `vo_takes`.
- **Naming Convention**: Name each file concisely, starting with the character's name. For example, a file for Medi could be named `Medi_a.wav`.
- **Content per File**: Ensure that each file contains takes for only one specific line.
- **Multiple Takes**: Encourage multiple takes for each line, but keep them within a single file for that line. Between each take, maintain approximately 2 seconds of silence.
- **Editing**: Remove any extraneous sounds from the recordings and ensure that each take is cleanly edited.
- **Normalization**: Normalize the peak of each voice-over file to -5 dBFs.
- **Background Noise and Acoustics**: Achieve minimal background noise and room reflections in each recording. Employ close miking techniques to ensure clarity and presence.
- **Silence Duration**: Limit the silence at both the beginning and the end of each file to less than 0.25 seconds.

### Documentation and Communication

- **Voice Talent Notes**: If you have specific observations or instructions related to the recorded voice-overs, note them down in the `Voice Talent Notes` field.
- **Script Sheet / Asset List**: A script sheet, also referred to as an asset list, outlines the lines required for each character. After recording a line, update the `script-sheet.xlsx` by entering the corresponding filename and any pertinent notes in the `Voice Talent Notes` column. Your notes should provide clear and actionable guidance to the Game Designer on how to utilize the voice-over assets.

### Studio Booking and Usage

For the recording sessions, you are required to use the DSU recording studio. Ensure you reserve your studio time well in advance through the Charm Studios website:

By adhering to these detailed guidelines and requirements, you will produce professional-quality voice-over assets that significantly contribute to the narrative and character portrayal in the game.

<!-- # Exercise 3: Voice Over

## Assignment

You are tasked with recording voice over assets for an upcoming story based adventure game.

You are to record the voice over assets for two characters, **Medi** and **Samsel**. **Medi** is a young sidekick companion to the main character. **Samsel** is a mystical old sage whose advice is not always helpful. Both characters' avatars are gender non-specific.

You will record voice over assets and deliver them, along with an updated [`script-sheet.xlsx`](script-sheet.xlsx) file.

You can read the lines yourself or recruit voice over talent, but **You are required to be the recording engineer.** I will be looking for well recorded/edited audio, not perfect performances.

### Audio asset requirements

- **Each file must be a 24bit, 44.1kHz .wav file.**
- Each sound should be in a directory called `vo_takes`
- Filenames should be short, and start with the character name:
  - For example:
    - `Medi_a.wav`
- Each file should only contain takes for one line
- Multiple takes for each line are encouraged
  - please keep to one file per line reading
  - please edit out any extraneous sounds
  - keep ~2 seconds of silence between each take
- Each file should be peak normalized to -5 dBFs
- Each take should have minimal background noise and room reflections
- Each take should be close mic'd
- Each file should have less than 0.25 seconds of silence at beginning
- Each file should have less than 0.25 seconds of silence at ending

### Communication

If needed, please leave any notes on the sounds provided in the `Voice Talent Notes` field.

An script sheet / asset list is provided with a list of requested lines. **Update `script-sheet.xlsx` with the filename, and any notes you have for the game designer.** Notes should be clear in meaning and directed toward the Game Designer in how to use the sound.

### Studio Usage
