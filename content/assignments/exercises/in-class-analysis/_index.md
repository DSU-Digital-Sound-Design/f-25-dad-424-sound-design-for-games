# Activity: Exploring Non-Linear Games and Sound

What you’ll do:  
In this activity, you’ll work in groups to play some classic games online. These games all have non-linear elements (branching paths, exploration, or choices that change the experience). After playing, you’ll talk with your group about what you noticed, especially how different game genres (like RPG, action, or strategy) use sound in unique ways. Then you’ll share your findings with the class.

---

## Why this matters
- Games don’t always follow a straight, linear story. Non-linear design makes each playthrough unique.  
- Different genres have different sound expectations. For example:  
  - **RPG/Adventure:** ambient sounds and music that respond to player choices.  
  - **Action/FPS:** clear, punchy sounds that react quickly to your actions.  
  - **Strategy:** layered sounds that help you track lots of things at once.  
  - **MMO/Multiplayer:** balancing the sound of the world with many player actions at once.

## Step 1: Play (25 minutes)
As a group, pick a game from one of these sites and play it together:  
- [PlayCLASSIC.games](https://www.playclassic.games/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) – classics like *Doom* and *Oregon Trail*.  
- [EmuBrowser](https://emubrowser.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) – NES, SNES, Genesis, PS1, and more.  
- [Retrogames.cc](https://www.retrogames.cc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) – huge library of retro consoles.  
- [Internet Archive Arcade](https://archive.org/details/internetarcade?utm_source=chatgpt.com) – over 900 arcade games.  
- [Piepacker](https://piepacker.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) – retro games you can play together with built-in video chat.  

While you play, notice:  
- Where do you see non-linear choices or freedom?  
- How does the sound react to your actions?  
- How does the genre of the game shape its sound?  
- Do you hear any of these non-linear sound features?  
  - **Branching music** – different tracks depending on choices.  
  - **Stingers** – short musical hits when events happen.  
  - **Adaptive layers** – music adding or dropping instruments with intensity.  
  - **Procedural sounds** – generated differently each playthrough.  
  - **Branching dialogue** – different spoken lines depending on your choices.  
  - **Environmental reactivity** – sound changes with movement or interaction.  
  - **Looping and transitions** – how music shifts between states like battle and exploration.

## Step 2: Discuss (10 minutes)
Stop playing and talk with your group. Write down answers to:  
1. What game and genre did you play?  
2. What example of non-linearity did you notice?  
3. How did sound design fit the genre expectations?  
4. How could the audio have been improved?  

---

## Step 3: Present (20 minutes)
Each group will give a short 3–5 minute presentation:  
- Show or describe the game you played.  
- Share your example of non-linear design.  
- Explain how the sound fit (or didn’t fit) what you’d expect for that genre.  

We’ll do a quick Q&A after each group to connect the ideas.

# Assignment: Non-Linear Game and Sound Reflection

**Due:** Upload to D2L by tonight at 11:59 pm.

Task:  
Write a short reflection (about 1 page or 250–300 words) about the game your group played. Do this individually—don’t just copy group notes.  

In your reflection, answer:  
- What game did your group play and what genre does it belong to?  
- What example of non-linearity did you notice? This could include:  
   - **Branching music**  
   - **Stingers**  
   - **Adaptive layers**  
   - **Procedural sounds**  
   - **Branching dialogue**  
   - **Environmental reactivity**  
   - **Looping and transitions**  
- How did the sound design fit the genre expectations?  
- If you could add or change one audio element to support non-linear design better, what would it be?  

Submission format:  
- About 250–300 words (roughly 1 page).  
- Microsoft Word document. 
- Upload to D2L.  

Grading (5 points total):  
- 2 pts: Clear description of the game and a non-linear element.  
- 2 pts: Thoughtful comments on sound and genre.  
- 1 pt: Clear, organized writing.  

This is a small, low-stakes assignment—it’s about showing you thought carefully about the activity.
