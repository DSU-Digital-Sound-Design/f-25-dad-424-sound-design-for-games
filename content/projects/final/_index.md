# Final Group Project — FMOD + Unity Audio Implementation

## Overview

You will work in teams of three or four, taking on industry-style roles: Composer, Sound Designer, Technical Sound Designer/Integrator, and (optional) Audio Lead/Producer. Roles may overlap, but every student should have a primary and secondary responsibility.

You may either:

* **Path A:** Collaborate with Game Design students on an in-progress Unity game.
* **Path B:** Retrofit audio into a free/licensed Unity project.

This is an ungrading project. Your evaluation will be based on completeness, application of semester concepts, collaboration, and reflection — not point-by-point scoring. Your work will grow each week by adding new FMOD + Unity features you’ve learned throughout the semester.

## Proposal & Asset List (Submitted Before the Main Project)

Before beginning work, you will submit an Asset List Proposal in a separate assignment:

* Use [this Google Sheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hOHveo41WSkGXwCtHycEL7ybb_n7sakXeajELZCJAGU/edit?usp=sharing) as a starting point.
* Create at least 20 events for your game; each event can have multiple audio assets.
* Include team member names, your game title, and role assignments (who will do what).
* Treat this as your project proposal — it will guide your work for the rest of the project.
* The number of assets you are expected to complete will depend on your group size.
* You will submit the completed and updated version of this list again at the end of the project.

## Project Requirements

By the end of the five weeks, your game should include:

1. **Core FMOD Integration**

   * Unity ↔ FMOD linked correctly.
   * Event instances, 3D positioning, and spatialization.
2. **Interactive Audio**

   * ≥2 gameplay-driven parameters affecting audio.
   * Audio attached to animations.
   * PlayOneShot usage for one-off SFX.
3. **Adaptive Music**

   * At least 3 musical states (e.g., explore, tension, combat).
   * One vertical layering system.
   * One horizontal transition with sync points.
4. **Mixing & Performance**

   * Bus and VCA control.
   * Snapshot-based mix changes.
   * Voice limiting and asset compression decisions.
5. **Advanced Feature**

   * At least one from Module 6 (return functions, delegates, event callbacks, or programmer instruments).
6. **Original Content**

   * Original music composed by students.
   * Field/studio recordings for SFX when possible.

* Implement and trigger at least 5 core sounds with 3D positioning.

### Week 2 — Parameters & Animation Hooks

* Add gameplay-driven parameters.
* Attach audio to animations (e.g., footsteps).
* Use PlayOneShot for quick effects.

### Week 3 — Multi-Script Control & Early Adaptive Music

* Control audio across multiple scripts.
* Add at least 2 music states and a transition between them.
* Begin bus control for mixing.

### Week 4 — Mix, Snapshots & Optimization

* Add snapshot-based mix changes.
* Implement VCAs.
* Add third music state and vertical layering.
* Begin performance optimization.

### Week 5 — Advanced Feature & Final Polish

* Implement at least one Module 6 advanced feature.
* Finalize mix and transitions.
* Prepare documentation, screen recording, and postmortem.

## Final Deliverables

* Playable build (PC/WebGL) + cleaned Unity and FMOD projects.
* **Final Asset List** (updated from proposal) showing planned vs. completed assets and who did what.
* **Integration Spec** with event/parameter documentation.
* **Screen recording** demonstrating all features.
* **Postmortem & Self-Assessment** (1–2 pages):

  * What you achieved.
  * How you applied course concepts.
  * Challenges and how you solved them.
  * What you would do next if you had more time.
