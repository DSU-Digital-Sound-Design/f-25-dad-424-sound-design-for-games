Here are some Unity games that I have been able to install and run. I've also been able to get Wwise integrated.

> When installing be careful to have the correct version of Wwise installed before you attempt to integrate. See the documentation [here](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/library/edge/?source=Unity&id=pg_releasenotes.html). You want to have the newest version of Wwise that supports the version of Unity used to create the game. Wwise will try to do this automatically for you, but this doesn't always work for me.
