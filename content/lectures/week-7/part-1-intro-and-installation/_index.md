Now we will begin to learn how to integrate Unity and Wwise.

> Note: Wwise and Unity installations require a lot of space. Ensure you have around 20 GB of free space before starting the installation process.

<!-- TODO: simplify this process a lot, don't install WAG
Use the newest Unity version and install the example games from there to ensure they will work with student's systems. 
 -->

# Installation

Both Unity and Wwise projects are run through launchers or hubs. We'll need to download and install the [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) and the [Wwise Launcher](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/download). You'll need user accounts for both programs.

After these programs are both installed, launch them. From both launchers, you can launch Unity Games and Wwise audio projects. You can also manage editor versions of both programs. You may end up having multiple versions of Unity for different projects. This is an important feature to enable stability.

## Wwise

> See the [Release Notes - Wwise Unity Integration 2022.1.1.8100.2644](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/library/edge/?source=Unity&id=pg_releasenotes.html) for the information on which version of Unity will work with the most updated version of Wwise.

Install the latest version of Wwise from the Wwise Launcher. Select the Authoring, SDK, and Samples packages. Choose your current OS as the deployment platform. Deselect all plug-ins and click install to install Wwise.

Click on the samples tab of the Wwise Launcher and install the latest version of the Wwise Adventure Game. On the next page, select _Unity Source Project_.

## Unity

Open up the Unity Hub, select the _Installs_ tab, and click on _Install Editor_. Install the version that is suggested here:

[Release Notes - Wwise Unity Integration 2022.1.1.8100.2644](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/library/edge/?source=Unity&id=pg_releasenotes.html)

Click on _Unity Hub_ to open it in the Unity Hub. Download the Visual Studio Devtools if you need them. Select support for your OS for the deployment platform. You should be able to see the editor downloading in the downloads section of the Hub.

<!-- ## Playing the Wwise Adventure Game (WAG)

Return to the Wwise Launcher application. To play a build of the WAG, click the wrench icon and select _open containing folder_. A build of the game should be in the _WwiseAdventureGame_ folder.

Play the game for about 10 minutes to get a feel for it. -->

## Creating a new Unity project

In the Unity Hub, select _New Project_. Select the _3D Core_ template. Also, set your editor version to the latest one you have installed. Once this project is installed, it should open automatically. We now have a project with two _GameObjects_ for the camera and light. You can close the project now.

## Integrate Wwise Into a Unity Project

Now, return to the Wwise Launcher and select the Unity tab. You'll see all your installed projects here. Notice that you now have buttons to _Integrate Wwise Into Project_. Select this option for your recent Unity project. Donâ€™t change any settings and select integrate. After you finish the integration, your Unity project should open automatically. If it doesn't open, go to the Wwise launcher and select _open in Unity_.

Notice the new _Wwise Picker_ tab next to the _Project_ and _Console_ tabs. The Wwise setup process added a WwiseGlobal object, which holds the main logic for Wwise. Finally, on the main camera, we have an _AkGameObj_.

Return to the Wwise launcher and select _open in Wwise_ to open your Wwise project. You should now see that the programs are connected and that the red flashing text has turned green. Also, in the _Wwise Picker_ tab, we have some new options corresponding to Wwise options.
