# Interpreting Code: Understanding Game Scripts as an Audio Designer

When designing sound for games, we often spend our time inside FMOD, Wwise, or Unity’s audio windows—triggering events, mixing layers, and crafting dynamic soundscapes. But at some point, we hit a barrier: to make our sounds respond to gameplay, we need to understand *the game’s code.*

This post walks you through the fundamentals of reading and using existing scripts—without needing to become a full-on programmer. It’s about collaboration, curiosity, and creative problem-solving through code.

---

## General vs. Custom Audio Implementation

Audio in games generally falls into two categories:

### General Implementation

These sounds use built-in tools from Unity or FMOD. You don’t need to touch other scripts to make them work.
Examples include ambient loops, trigger-based footsteps, or teleport sounds using Unity’s collider system.

### Custom Implementation

These sounds rely on *code written by developers*. They interact with the game’s systems—like dynamic music that changes when the player enters combat or a car engine pitch that follows RPM.

| Aspect        | General Implementation                                                                 | Custom Implementation                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What it is    | Uses built-in tools in Unity or FMOD; no script edits needed                           | Relies on developer-written code; hooks into gameplay systems                         |
| Examples      | Ambient loops; trigger-based footsteps; teleport sounds via colliders                  | Dynamic music reacting to combat; engine pitch following RPM                          |

To handle these, you’ll need to identify where the relevant variables and functions live in code.

## Reading Game Code Without Fear

Let’s use Unity’s **PlayerController** script (from the 3D Game Kit) as an example. Even without programming experience, you can learn a lot by exploring the script methodically.

### 1. Look at Variable Names

Names like `JumpSpeed`, `Gravity`, or `m_ReadyToJump` tell you their purpose.
If a variable is *public*, you’ll also see it in Unity’s Inspector—meaning you or another script can adjust it at runtime.

In another script attached to Ellen you could have: 
```csharp
public class EllenAudio : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Reference to the PlayerController script
    private PlayerController pc;

    void Start() {
        // Get the PlayerController component
        pc = GetComponent<PlayerController>();
        pc.JumpSpeed = 10.0f; // Example of accessing JumpSpeed variable
    }
}
```

You might also spot variables like:

```csharp
bool m_IsGrounded;
bool m_PreviouslyGrounded;
```

These booleans (true/false variables) control jumping logic. Understanding their behavior helps us know when to trigger audio—like footsteps, landings, or jump sounds.

---

### 2. Read the Programmer Notes

Most scripts include comments after `//`.
These notes explain why a line of code exists. For example:

```csharp
// Whether or not the input state and Ellen are correct to allow jumping
```

Comments like this tell you the intent behind a variable—perfect clues when you’re connecting audio to gameplay.

---

### 3. Trace Variables in Code

In Visual Studio or VS Code, double-click a variable to highlight every place it’s used.
Follow it through the script to see *where it changes value*.

You can also right click and select "Find All References" to see every instance of that variable in the script.

For example, you might find:

```csharp
void FixedUpdate()
{
    m_PreviouslyGrounded = m_IsGrounded;
    CalculateVerticalMovement();
}
```

`FixedUpdate()` runs 50 times per second—ideal for physics checks.
Here, the code tracks whether Ellen *was* on the ground last frame versus *is* on the ground now. That’s exactly the kind of information you could use for sound triggers.

---

## Debugging to Learn

Debugging isn’t just for programmers—it’s an *auditory designer’s microscope.*
By adding a simple print statement, you can *watch* how the game behaves in real-time.

Add this line to your script:

```csharp
Debug.Log("IG: " + m_IsGrounded + " PG: " + m_PreviouslyGrounded);
```

When you run the game, Unity’s Console will display the variables each frame.
Jump, and you’ll see them flip from true to false and back again.

To filter specific moments, use an `if` statement:

```csharp
if (m_PreviouslyGrounded != m_IsGrounded)
    Debug.Log("Grounded state changed!");
```

This reports only when the player leaves or touches the ground—an exact moment you might trigger a landing sound or dust effect.

We could use this information now to play a jump sound when the player leaves the ground and a landing sound when they touch down.

---

## Searching Through Scripts

Large scripts can feel overwhelming. Thankfully, you can search them.

**Ctrl+F (Windows)** or **Cmd+F (Mac)** brings up a search bar.
Search for a term like `die`, and you might find a function:

```csharp
void Die()
{
    // Called when the player loses all health
}
```

Now you’ve found the perfect place to play a “death cry” sound.

---

## A Custom Audio Example

Once you find the `Die()` function, adding sound is simple:

```csharp
FMODUnity.RuntimeManager.PlayOneShotAttached("event:/Player/Death", gameObject);
```

That single line links FMOD to Unity, playing your event when the player dies.
You can test it instantly—jump into the water or get hit by an enemy, and your audio should trigger when the character respawns.

---

## Knowing When to Collaborate

Sometimes you’ll find that the data you need—like enemy states or vehicle speed—comes from complex systems spread across many scripts. When that happens, it’s best to collaborate with the programmers. They can create clean hooks for audio events faster than you can reverse-engineer the code.

However, by understanding the basics, you can communicate clearly:

> “I noticed there’s a `bool inCombat` variable in EnemyAI.cs. Could we use that to switch FMOD music states?”

That kind of precise collaboration makes your work more efficient—and helps the whole team.

---

## Practice: Explore the PlayerController

Here’s your challenge:

1. Open the `PlayerController` script.
2. Find the `PlayAudio()` function—used to trigger one-shots for footsteps, jumps, and impacts.
3. See what conditions must be true before it runs.
4. Use `Debug.Log()` to print out those variables to the Console.
5. Try connecting one of them to an FMOD event.

You’ll be surprised how much you already understand—and how quickly “interpreting code” becomes part of your creative toolkit.

---

## Closing Thoughts

Understanding code isn’t about becoming a programmer.
It’s about reading the systems behind your sounds, identifying where to connect, and knowing when to collaborate.

By interpreting scripts, you gain control over how your soundscapes react to gameplay—and make your audio as dynamic as the worlds you build.
