---

## Producer

- The one who has to make the project work
- Must be detail oriented and good at dealing with people
- Coordinates all the parties involved in the process
- When it comes to getting things right the first time\, they have to be prepared\, because nobody wants to re\-schedule and re\-record high powered voice talent―it’s not easy―or cheap

---

## Writer

- Creative writing is a growing and important market in the game world
- Writers imagine the lines that the actors will perform
- Must be creative and practical
- Voice\-over takes up space\, so writers must work with the game designers and producers to craft characters and situations

---

## Union vs non\-union talent

- Using non\-union actors allows for a certain amount of flexibility in negotiating rates and availability
- Union projects demand considerably more paperwork and come with many restrictions\, such as the number of consecutive hours the actor can work
- Union projects tend to have a higher degree of quality

---

## Voice director

- Works directly with the talent in the recording studio to make sure the script is professionally performed and well recorded
- Coaches talent on multiple line deliveries
- Translates between the game producer and the voice talent
- Helps a producer communicate with the performer to achieve a desired result

---

# Dialogue Production Basics

---

## What Does a Script Look Like?

- Scripts can come in all shapes and sizes
- Creating well\-rounded characters with appropriate dialogue is a must
- Voice\-overs need to be an integral part of the video game developing process

---

## Recording Engineer

- Gets the voice\-over recorded
- Runs the necessary hardware and software
- Makes sure the quality and sound of the voice is squeaky clean

---

# Tools of the Trade―The Microphone

---

## Microphone

- A device that changes sound into an electrical signal
- Uses a microphone preamplifier \(mic preamp\) that is built into the microphone itself
- **Dynamic microphones** are most common for live music and pop music in general
- **Condenser microphones** are more commonly used for professional voice recording

---

## Preparing the space for Recording

- To get the best recording quality\, you want a clean and robust signal to start with
- Clean and free of extraneous background noise or any distortion
- When voice\-over files are compressed\, noise can become louder and make the files sound bad to the ear

---

# Choosing a Studio

- Recording studios come in all shapes and sizes\, not to mention prices
- Studio do not have to cost a ton of money to deliver good quality voice\-over
- Most important is the signal quality\, isolation of the vocal booth\, and the kind of microphones available
- Since oftentimes producers and actors will be stuck in the studio for long hours\, the more comfortable the space the better

---

# Editing Engineer

- Voice\-over editing takes time and patience
- An editor takes the raw voice\-over session and cuts it up line by line\, creating unique files
- Uses file naming conventions set up by the producer
- Coherent and well thought out name conventions are critical so the producer and programmer knows where each one is supposed to go in the game

---

- Chooses the best take if the producer or voice director does not mark the lines they prefer
- Balances volume for each file so one character is not louder than the other
- Converts formats into a designed file format that works with each particular platform type

---

# Programmer/Integrator

- Inserts each file into the game engine
- _How_ this is done depends on the platform
- Chooses the best method for each game to be inserted depending on the interactive structure of the project
- Most platforms have multiple ways in which audio gets triggered

---

# Translated and Localized Video Game Voice-Overs

- Today\, games are made in every developed nation on the planet
- One of the challenges is that often a game is developed in one language and then “localized” to English or vice versa
- Often
- When it comes to dialogue\, this includes not only accurate translations\, but also the artistry and tone of the characters’ lines
