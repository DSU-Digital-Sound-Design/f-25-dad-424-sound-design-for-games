Wwise tutorial - [Lesson 2: Designing a soundscape](https://www.audiokinetic.com/courses/wwise101/?source=wwise101&id=designing_soundscape)

- Look at the game and list things that we could add sounds to.
- Another way to add sounds to the project
- using a single sound for multiple applications
- assign multiple actions to single event
  - Adding randomization
  - Create a sequence of random events
- Build your soundbank and test it in the game.
- If it isn't exactly what you want make some changes and rebuild
