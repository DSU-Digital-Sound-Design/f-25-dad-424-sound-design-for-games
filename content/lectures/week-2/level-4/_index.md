- Game mechanics and genres are not static; they evolve and sometimes blend, creating hybrid genres. This fluidity means that audio professionals must stay adaptable and innovative.

## Evolution of Shooter Games: FPS and TPS

- Emergence of Shooter Games in the 1970s
- Evolution to Networked Multiplayer Gameplay
- First-Person Shooter (FPS): Immersive Perspective
- Third-Person Shooter (TPS): Avatar-Driven Visuals

{{% note %}}

- Shooter games, branching from shoot 'em ups, introduced a three-dimensional, more immersive gaming experience. Initially single-player, these games evolved to include networked multiplayer gameplay, expanding the competitive aspect.
- FPS games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D pioneered the first-person perspective, offering a view directly from the character's eyes, with a primary focus on the weapons held. This perspective deeply immerses players in the game, making FPS games like Unreal Tournament and Call Of Duty massively popular.
- TPS games, on the other hand, provide a view from above and behind the character, offering a broader visual context. This perspective allows players to see their characters and their interactions with the game environment, adding a different layer of engagement. Influential TPS games like Tomb Raider, Assassin’s Creed, and Metal Gear Solid have significantly contributed to the genre's high popularity.
- Both FPS and TPS games have significantly influenced the gaming industry, each offering unique perspectives and gameplay experiences. Sound design for these games is crucial, as it needs to complement the immersive visual experience, adding depth and realism to the gameplay.

{{% note %}}

- Sports games, such as Madden NFL and NBA 2K, require audio that mirrors the real-life sounds of sports, from the crowd's roar to the distinctive sounds of different activities. The first arcade game with sound, Pong, set the foundation for this genre.
- MUDs and MMORPGs like Ultima Online and Rift present complex audio challenges due to their unpredictable and varied in-game scenarios. Sound design must account for numerous players interacting in a dynamic environment, requiring a balance between detail and clarity.
- Strategy games, including real-time and turn-based variants like Command & Conquer and Civilization, demand audio that complements strategic thinking and planning. Kent Jolly emphasizes the unique sound design considerations in strategy/simulation games, such as dealing with a displaced camera view and managing sound sources at varying distances.
- Serious and educational games focus on problem-solving and learning, requiring engaging and supportive audio. Simulation games like SimCity and casual games like Bejeweled offer a broad scope for innovative sound design, enhancing player immersion and learning.
