Started with one screen at a time - Space Invaders and Pacman. Each level just made the game harder.

Games with scrolling backgrounds became the start of what we consider level design today. This gave the player more to do and look at.

## Contrasting game levels

The next innovation is contrasting game levels. In these types of games, the player progresses in some way though the level, like a maze or obstacle course until they reach the goal at the end, and then the next level loads; or perhaps it’s a character going from room to room searching for specific items.

We now might have a reason to change the music, as our character or player is potentially in a different emotional environment than before. As far as sounds are concerned, it might affect ambiences or sound effects as animations change from level to level.

These gameplay mechanics were necessary for the hardware limitations of the time, but are still popular ways to design games.

## Evolution of Games

## Action Games

- Game design
  - Levels
  - Character abilities
  - Obstacles and enemies
  - Health and Lives
  - Graphics and interface
  - Scoring and victory

{{% note %}}
Defining elements: The action genre includes any game where the player overcomes challenges by physical means such as precise aim and quick response times.[1] Action games can sometimes incorporate other challenges such as races, puzzles, or collecting objects, but they are not central to the genre. Players may also encounter tactical and exploration challenges, but these games first-and-foremost require high reaction speed and good hand–eye coordination. The player is often under time pressure, and there is not enough time for complex strategic planning. In general, faster action games are more challenging. Action games may sometimes involve puzzle solving, but they are usually quite simple because the player is under immense time pressure.[2]

- Levels
  - how the character advances through the game, can be grouped by themes
  - each level has a variety of challenges depending on the type of action
  - sometimes players can restart the game after dying
  - levels give a higher degree of complexity to sound design as each level can have a totally different group of sound effects and music.
- Character abilities
  - single avatar, the protagonist
  - must have sounds for the character moving around, collecting and manipulating objects.
  - can have many abilities such as shooting or punching
- Obstacles and enemies
- Health and Lives
- Graphics and interface
  - 2d vs 3d, is there a difference in sound design?
- Scoring and victory

Let's think of how sound design works for each of these different catagories for the following examples.
