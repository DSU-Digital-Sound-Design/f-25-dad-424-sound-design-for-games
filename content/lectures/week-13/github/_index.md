When working with teams we need a way to share files back and forth in a way where our changes are recorded as we make them. Solutions like Google Drive work ok, but don't allow you to go back to earlier versions of a file or tell who changed what. https://github.com/ is a great way to do this.

Instead of using the command line like Hax0rs do, we can use the GitHub website and GitHub Desktop. You'll need to create an account on GitHub and download the desktop app. Once you create an account login to the desktop app. You'll see a list of your repositories. Since you haven't created any, this will be blank.

We will go and [fork the projects](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop#forking-a-repository) we want to work on. A fork is a copy of the project that you ca work on without breaking the original project. It also can receive updates from the game designers without breaking what you've already added to the project. If the designers decided that they want to incorporate your changes into their game, they can merge the changes into the original project.

Now that you have forked the project it should show up in the desktop app. The first time you add a project it may prompt you to `Initialize Git LFS`. This is a way to store large files in the repository. Press the button to initialize and continue.

Once you have a repository loaded check out the history. This is where you can see all of the changes that have been made to the project and committed since the game was created.
