## The First Video Games

[timeline](https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/history-of-gaming--22)

{{% note %}}
In 1948 Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr., and Estle Ray Mann created one of
the earliest known video games. Based on radar display technology, the cathode-ray tube used an analog device to simulate the experience of firing a missile at targets. Knobs and buttons allowed the player to control the missile, which was represented on screen by a vector-drawn dot.

## The Silent Era of Video Games (1940–1970)

- Beginnings: University Mainframe Computers
- Notable Early Games: OXO and Spacewar!
- The First Home Console: Magnavox Odyssey

{{% note %}}

- Video game development started in universities in the late 1950s, primarily by students using mainframe computers. These early games were not commercially distributed and were often developed clandestinely.
- In 1952, A.S. Douglas created OXO, a tic-tac-toe game, to demonstrate human-computer interaction. Spacewar!, developed in 1961, was a two-player game involving spacecraft combat and is considered one of the first influential computer games.
- The Magnavox Odyssey, designed by Ralph Baer in 1966 and released in 1972, was the first home video game console. Its tennis game inspired Atari’s Pong. Notably, the Odyssey had no sound capabilities, reflecting the era's technical limitations.

## The Dawn of Sound in Video Games (1970–1980)

- Introduction of Sound in Arcade Games
- Technology Behind Early Game Sounds
- Role of Sound Designers and Composers

{{% note %}}

- The 1970s marked the introduction of the first basic sounds in arcade games, characterized by simple "bleeps" and "bloops."
- These sounds were generated using hardware chips, oscillators, and basic tone generators like sine and square waves. This approach represented the early methods of creating game audio.
- Sound designers and composers during this era often had backgrounds in electrical engineering. Creating game sounds was a complex process, much like computer programming, reflecting the technical challenges of early game sound development.

## Pong (1972), Atari - Nolan Bushnell

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fiShX2pTz9A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}

- Atari, founded by Nolan Bushnell, achieved its first major success with the arcade game Pong. Initially programmed as a practice exercise by engineer Allan Alcorn, Pong was inspired by paddle tennis games on the Magnavox Odyssey.
- Bushnell's decision to include sound effects in Pong was revolutionary. Using a sync generator, Alcorn created three distinct sounds: a low-pitched blip for wall collisions, a higher-pitched blip for paddle strikes, and a bleep for scoring points.
- Pong's popularity was significantly boosted by its sound effects, which attracted attention and curiosity. It became one of the first arcade games with sound and was a best-seller, establishing Atari as a leader in the early video game industry.
- Pong also transitioned into a home console game, inspiring numerous clones and leading to the video game industry's first slump. Atari later revitalized the market with the Atari VCS or 2600, the first major console with a sound chip.

## Atari 2600 (1977): 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6RxENG9HAU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}

- The Atari 2600, launched in 1977, represented a significant advancement in home gaming consoles. It featured a CPU, combined with RAM for short-term memory, I/O functions, and a display and sound chip named the TIA (Television Interface Adaptor).
- This console's four-chip design allowed for cost-effective manufacturing and the ability to load different programs, enhancing game diversity.
- The Atari 2600's sound, though technologically primitive with 2 channels of 1-bit monaural sound and 4-bit volume control, became iconic in the gaming world. Its distinct, quirky, and raw audio quality is still recognized and cherished by game enthusiasts and chiptune music fans.
- Despite its limited bit sound, the Atari 2600’s audio was groundbreaking for its time, contributing to the console's immense popularity and enduring cultural legacy in the realm of video game music.

{{% note %}}

By 1980, arcade manufacturers included dedicated sound chips known as programmable sound generators, or PSGs (see box 2.1, ‘‘Sound Synthesis’’) into their circuit boards, and more tonal background music and elaborate sound effects developed. Some of the earliest examples of repeating musical loops in games were found in Rally X (Namco/Midway, 1980), which had a six-bar loop (one bar repeated four times, followed by the same melody transposed to a lower pitch),

Namco's 1980 arcade game Rally-X was the first known game to use a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to produce sampled tones instead of a tone generator.

## Sega Genesis and Sega CD

- Sega Genesis: A Leap in Sound Quality
- Introduction of Sega CD
- Expansion of Audio Capabilities and Challenges

{{% note %}}

- Sega entered the console market concurrently with Nintendo, achieving notable success with the Sega Genesis (or Mega Drive) in 1988. Despite having less memory capacity than its contemporaries, with 64KB of RAM and 8KB for sound, the Genesis marked a significant improvement in sound quality.
- The Genesis featured a Yamaha FM chip with built-in sounds and 6 stereo audio channels, enhancing the audio experience considerably compared to earlier consoles.
- The Sega CD, released in 1992, was a major advancement with its 500 MB CD-ROM disc, substantially increasing storage capacity. This allowed for enhanced graphics and sound, including 18 sound channels, a 44.1 KHz sample rate, and connections for household stereo systems.
- Games for the Sega CD could include fully produced opening cutscenes, intricate MIDI scores, numerous 16-bit stereo audio tracks, extensive sound effects, and extensive voice-overs. The complexity of mixing these audio elements was a significant challenge, showcasing the considerable evolution from the simpler audio capabilities of earlier systems like the NES.

## Super Famicom/Super NES

- Launch and Features of the Super NES
- Audio Capabilities of the Super NES
- Challenges in Achieving Quality Sound
- Balancing Audio with Other Game Elements

{{% note %}}

- In 1991, Nintendo introduced the Super Famicom in America as the Super NES (SNES), priced at $249.95. This 16-bit system featured a Sony SPC700 sound chip, providing eight channels and a sound capacity of 64KHz.
- The SNES allowed for audio streaming from the cartridge, enabling integration of premixed music, voice-over, and sound effects into games. However, this capability was limited by transfer rates.
- A significant challenge was the quality of 8-bit audio samples, which required expertise to balance and enhance to acceptable standards.
- The limited storage space of game cartridges (up to 6 Megabytes) necessitated compromises in audio quality. Audio often had a lower priority compared to graphics or cutscenes, leading to downsampling to fit within the memory constraints.
- The SNES had a total RAM size of up to 128KB, highlighting the ongoing challenge in gaming of balancing audio quality with file size constraints, a theme that persists even in modern gaming.

OST by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, he also recorded the sound effects

ambient music soundtrack

About the soundtrack, Reznor said, "it is not music, it's textures and ambiences and whirling machine noises and stuff. We tried to make the most sinister, depressive, scary, frightening kind of thing [...] It's been fun."
