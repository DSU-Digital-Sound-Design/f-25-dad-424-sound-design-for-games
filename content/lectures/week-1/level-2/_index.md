## The First Video Games

[timeline](https://www.museumofplay.org/video-game-history-timeline/)

{{% note %}}
In 1948 Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr., and Estle Ray Mann created one of
the earliest known video games. Based on radar display technology, the cathode-ray tube used an analog device to simulate the experience of firing a missile at targets. Knobs and buttons allowed the player to control the missile, which was represented on screen by a vector-drawn dot.


“What’s the first video game sound you remember?”

“Which era do you feel least familiar with: pre-1977, 8-bit, 16-bit, CD/PlayStation, modern engines?”

## Rally-X (1980), Namco

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJxbkhFPgb8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{{% note %}}

By 1980, arcade manufacturers included dedicated sound chips known as programmable sound generators, or PSGs (see box 2.1, ‘‘Sound Synthesis’’) into their circuit boards, and more tonal background music and elaborate sound effects developed. Some of the earliest examples of repeating musical loops in games were found in Rally X (Namco/Midway, 1980), which had a six-bar loop (one bar repeated four times, followed by the same melody transposed to a lower pitch),

Namco's 1980 arcade game Rally-X was the first known game to use a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) to produce sampled tones instead of a tone generator.

Constraint: memory for samples was tiny—mere kilobytes—so loops were short and heavily compressed.
