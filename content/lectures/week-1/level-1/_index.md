## Web-Based Games

One of the very first examples of going multiplatform is using an engine that has the same visual interface on every machine. Tools like Adobe’s Flash were used frequently to make interactive media and games,
and because the finished work could run on Mac or PC identically,
the experience for gamers was the same. The tradition of web-based gaming is currently evolving away from using Flash and is more and more dependent on HTML5 and Javascript.

## Is it a story or is it interactivity?

- video games as stories
- video games as an interactive experience

{{% note %}}
Can you name examples of either type?

One group of people regard a game as something related to a book, a play or other media based
on a story. Those interested in tying the concept of gaming as an extension to storytelling are called narrativists. They tend to regard video games as complex “cyberdramas” through which players can become other people and participate in other worlds. Of course, many games may have multiple conclusions and results due to the aspect of choice in the game. For narrativists this puts a video game into the category of interactive fiction.

The other group of people regard games primarily from the basis of the interactive structure within the game itself. Every game comes with its own set of rules and restrictions as to how the game should be played. These people are known as ludologists, and they look mainly at how the structure of the game places demands and restrictions on the player, and how the player then navigates their way through the restrictions in the game. These restrictions can then affect the social and artistic qualities of the game as a result.

They agree though that games depend on emergent principles where complex outcomes can result from the interaction of simple rules.

a documentary on emergence in games. Very interesting, but too long to show in class.

What's the point of talking about game design in a class on game audio? What sort of interesting issues does this fact of emergence in games bring up?
