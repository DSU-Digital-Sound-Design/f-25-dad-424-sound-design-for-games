DAD 424 is a hands-on course exploring the art and technology of sound design and music for video games. Students will learn to create, edit, and implement sound effects, voice-overs, and adaptive music using industry-standard tools such as FMOD, Unity, and Reaper.

**Course topics include:**
- The history and evolution of game audio and platforms
- Game genres and their unique audio requirements
- Fundamentals of interactive and adaptive audio
- Sound design workflow: sourcing, recording, editing, and organizing assets
- Voice-over production, editing, and integration
- Composing and implementing non-linear, dynamic music for games
- FMOD and Unity integration: event creation, parameter automation, and scripting basics in C#
- 3D audio, spatialization, and real-time mixing
- Advanced topics: parameter-driven systems, footsteps, collision sounds, and adaptive music structures
- Project management: asset lists, documentation, and collaboration

**Assignments and projects** are designed to build practical skills, including:
- Sourcing and creating sound assets for games
- Producing and editing voice-overs in a professional studio environment
- Designing and implementing UI and environmental sounds
- Building dynamic music systems and interactive audio in Unity with FMOD
- Collaborative and individual final projects demonstrating a complete game audio pipeline

By the end of the course, students will have a portfolio of game audio work and a strong foundation in both the creative and technical aspects of sound design for interactive media.
